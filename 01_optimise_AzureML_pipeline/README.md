# Project_01: Optimizing an ML pipeline in Azure

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create and optimize an ML pipeline. A custom-coded, standard **Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model** is provided, and its **hyperparameters** need to be optimised using _HyperDrive_. 
Then, AutoML is used to build and optimise a model on the same dataset, and the results of the two methods are compared.
