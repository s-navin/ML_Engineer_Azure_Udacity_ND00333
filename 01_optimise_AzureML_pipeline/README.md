# Project_01: Optimizing an ML pipeline in Azure
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Engineer Nanodegree.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create and optimize an ML pipeline using the _python_ SDK. A custom-coded, standard **scikit-learn Logistic Regression model** is developed, and its **hyperparameters** are optimised using _HyperDrive_. 
Then, **Azure AutoML** is used to build and optimise a model on the same dataset, and the results of the two methods are compared and reported out.

## Summary of the project

### Problem Statement: 

### Dataset
e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."
The ___ dataset from ___ site/repository, contains the following data: The classification/regression goal is to predict if ___. 
Therefore the input variables would be the fields representing _____ and the target variable would be the column representing ____

### Solution:
The ____ is ____ produced by the Azure AutomML run. It has a prediction accuracy of _____ when compared to the accuracy of ___ achieved by the scikit-learn LogisticRegression model, with hyperparameter tuning assistance from HyperDrive.

### Best performing model
e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## scikit-learn Pipeline

### Pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
### describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
### Compare the two models and their performance. 
**What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**Some areas of improvement for future experiments, and why these improvements might help the model**
