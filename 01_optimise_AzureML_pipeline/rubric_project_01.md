## Documentation
| Success Criteria |	Specifications  |  
|--------|:--------:|
| Explain the pipeline architecture. | The README contains an explanation of:  <br> 1. The pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm. <br> 2. The benefits of the chosen parameter sampler. <br> 3. The benefits of the chosen early stopping policy. |   
| Compare a provided model with one generated by AutoML. | The README contains: <br> 1. One or more sentences describing the model and parameters generated by AutoML. <br> 2. Two or more sentences comparing the two models and their performance. <br> |
| Explain and justify ways to improve models. | The README contains two or more sentences explaining potential improvements for a future experiment and why these improvements might improve the model. |

## Training Pipeline and AutoML
| Success Criteria |	Specifications  |  
|--------|:--------:|
| Pass parameters to training scripts. | All specifiable parameters of the training script are specified in the hyperdrive config. |
|  Use HyperDrive to automatically find optimal parameters. | A hyperdrive config is used and includes: <br> 1. A parameter sampler <br> 2. A policy for early stopping |
| Retrieve the best run using .get_best_run_by_primary_metric(). | .get_best_run_by_primary_metric() is used on the hyperdrive run to retrieve the best run. | 
| Use the RunDetails widget to explore run metrics. | The hyperdrive run is passed to the RunDetails widget. | 
| Create an AutoMLConfig for training. | The solution notebook includes an AutoML config, which contains the following parameters: <ul><li> task <li><li>primary_metric <li><li> experiment_timeout_minutes <li><li> training_data <li><li> label_column_name <li><li> n_cross_validations </li></ul> |

## Infrastructure
| Success Criteria |	Specifications  |  
|--------|:--------:|
|Create a compute cluster using the SDK. | A compute cluster is created using the Azure SDK and the ComputeTarget and AmlCompute objects. |
| Import data to a Dataset using the SDK.| A TabularDatasetFactory is used to create a dataset from the provided link.| 
| Clean up deployed resources. | The delete method of the AmlCompute object is used to remove the cluster following training, **OR**, An image of the compute cluster being selected for deletion is included in the README.|
